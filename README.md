injectable dll written for the [AMODUS-MultiHack-Client](https://github.com/devilb2103/AMODUS-MultiHack-Client).
## warning
  - all pointers are outdated, so making it work would require you to sell your soul in exchange for getting all the required pointers from the deobfuscated sourcecode of amongus
  - bad code because I didnt care because this was a part of a casual private only project.

instructions on how to use it on [AMODUS_INJECTOR](https://github.com/devilb2103/AMODUS_INJECTOR)
